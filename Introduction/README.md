## Data Structures

- It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accesses and updated efficiently.

## Time and Space Complexity

-Asymptotic notations are used to analyse the computational complexity of an algorithm.The computation complexity complexity is split into two parts.

1. Time complexity : It is the amount of time the alogorithm needs to run relative to the input size.

2. Space complexity : It is the amount of memory allocated by the alogorithm when run relative to the input size.

### 3 types of Asymptotic notations

- Big-Oh (O) notation (Worst case)
- Omega ( Ω ) notation (Best case)
- Theta ( Θ ) notation (Average case)
