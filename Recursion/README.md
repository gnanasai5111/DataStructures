## Recursion 

- Function calling itself is called recursion.

### Two types

1. Direct recursion - Function calling itself.
2. Indirect recursion - In this recursion, there may be more than one functions and they are calling one another in a circular manner.

### Direct recursion - 4 types
1. Tail recursion - If the recursive call is the last statement in the function then it’s known as Tail Recursion.
2. Head recursion - If the recursive call is the first statement in the function then it’s known as Head Recursion.
3. Tree recursion - If the recursive function is calling itself more than one time then its called as Tree Recursion
1. Tail recursion - If a recursive function is passed as a paramter in recursive call then it’s known as Nested Recursion.
